# Wormhole

Wormhole is a simple program to create a network channel between a source system and target system.
The program acts like a light-wight proxy, using the source system like a jump host to reach a far remote system.

The purpose of this project is mainly educational, and I generally write a version of Wormhole with every programming language I usually work with.

## Usage

### Python version

You can use the program directly:

```bash
python workhole.py --source <local-address>:<local-port> --target <remote-address>:<remote-port>
```

### Go version

```bash
wormhole.i64 --source <local-address>:<local-port> --target <remote-address>:<remote-port>
```

### Java version

The Java implementation was my first version, since I worked with this programming language for many years.

TBD
